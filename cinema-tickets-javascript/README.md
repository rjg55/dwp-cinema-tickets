# Candidate Name: Rick Graham

# Assumptions

- Input for TicketService is an object with format {accountID: xxx, tickets: {INFANT: X, CHILD: Y, ADULT: Z}}

# Notes

- issue with importing ticketpaymentservice and seatreservationservice meant I had to change their export methods but the functions remain unchanged.

- With more time I would have written more tests that assess when the ticketPurchaseDetails are presented in an unideal fashion (I stuck to the 'happy path' for this assignment!)
